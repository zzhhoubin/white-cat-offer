## Workflow

When the user provides a job posting (URL or text), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Research & Evaluate Fit
- Fetch the job posting content (use WebFetch for URLs)
- Analyze the posting for required competencies, keywords, and priorities
- Research the company (website, LinkedIn, mission, recent news)
- Score the posting against the candidate's profile using the framework in `04-job-evaluation.md`
- Present the evaluation table and verdict
- Suggest whether the candidate should call the employer before applying (see `04-job-evaluation.md` for guidance)
- Ask the user if they want to proceed with an application

### Step 2: Tailor CV
- Read the most relevant existing CV variant from `cv/` as a starting point
- Follow the guidelines in `05-cv-templates.md`
- Create `cv/main_<company>.tex` with tailored content
- Adjust: profile statement, skills section, experience bullet emphasis, section order

### Step 3: Write Cover Letter
- Follow the writing style rules in `03-writing-style.md` (critical: no em-dashes, no cliches)
- Follow the template structure in `06-cover-letter-templates.md`
- Create `cover_letters/cover_<company>_<role>.tex`
- Ensure the letter connects specific experience to the role requirements

### Step 4: Interview Preparation
- Follow the framework in `07-interview-prep.md`
- Prepare STAR-format answers for likely questions
- Identify role-specific talking points
- Draft questions the candidate should ask the interviewer
