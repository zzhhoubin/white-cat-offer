# Job Scraper

---

## How It Works

This skill searches job portals using the **installed portal-search CLIs** in
`.agents/skills/` (plus WebSearch as a fallback), using queries from your profile.
It deduplicates against previously seen jobs and the application tracker, and
presents new matches with a quick fit assessment.

## Invocation

The user triggers this skill by saying things like:
- "Find new jobs"
- "Scrape for jobs"
- "Any new positions?"
- "/scrape"

Optional arguments:
- A focus area, e.g. "/scrape data science" or "/scrape geophysics"
- "broad" to run all search categories, e.g. "/scrape broad"

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Load State

1. Read `job_scraper/seen_jobs.json` (create if missing - start with `{"seen": {}}`)
2. Read `job_search_tracker.csv` to extract already-applied companies+roles
3. Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy

### Step 1: Search

Read `search-queries.md` (this directory) for the search strategy. By default, run the top 3 priority query categories. If the user said "broad", run all categories. If the user specified a focus area (e.g. "data science"), prioritize queries from that category.

**Use the installed CLI tools as the primary search mechanism.** Fall back to `WebSearch` only for portals that do not have a CLI skill, or if `bun` is unavailable on the system.

#### 1a. Check bun availability

```bash
bun --version
```

If this fails (bun not installed), skip to **1c (WebSearch fallback)** for all portals and note the fallback in the Step 5 output.

#### 1b. Run CLI tools (primary — run these in parallel where possible)

Discover all installed portal CLI skills by reading every `SKILL.md` found under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`. Each file documents that portal's exact CLI flags and usage examples. **Use each portal's own documented interface — do not guess flags.** This approach automatically includes any new portals added via `/add-portal` without requiring changes to this file.

For each installed portal skill:

1. Read its `SKILL.md` to find the correct `bun run …` invocation and supported flags.
2. Translate the query terms from `search-queries.md` into that portal's flag format (e.g. `--key`, `--search-string`, `--query`, filter codes — whatever the portal's SKILL.md specifies).
3. Scope to the last 14 days using the portal's supported recency flag (`--jobage`, `--since <YYYY-MM-DD>`, `--order PublicationDate`, etc. — as documented per portal).
4. Cap results to ~20 per call using the portal's limit flag.
5. Use `--format json` for machine-readable output.

Run all portal CLI calls in parallel where possible using the Agent tool. Collect all `results` arrays into a single pool for Step 2, keeping each result tagged with its source portal skill (for Step 2 `detail` lookups).

If a CLI tool exits with a non-zero code, log the error message and continue — do not abort the whole search.

#### 1c. WebSearch fallback

Use `WebSearch` for:
- Portals listed in `search-queries.md` that do **not** have a corresponding directory under `.agents/skills/`
- Any portal whose CLI fails at runtime
- When bun is unavailable (Step 1a failed)

Use the site-specific query strings from `search-queries.md` directly as WebSearch queries for these portals.

### Step 2: Fetch & Parse

For each promising result from Step 1:

**From CLI results:** Search output already includes title, company, location, date,
and URL. For jobs worth a deeper look, fetch full detail with that portal's `detail`
command (see its SKILL.md — do not guess flags) to extract **key requirements**,
**application deadline**, and a brief description snippet.

**From WebSearch results:** Use `WebFetch` on the posting URL and extract the same
fields manually.

For every candidate:
- Skip if the URL or company+title combo already exists in `seen_jobs.json`
- Skip if the company+role already appears in `job_search_tracker.csv`

### Step 3: Quick Fit Assessment

For each new job, do a rapid fit check (NOT the full evaluation from `04-job-evaluation.md` - just a quick signal):

- **High match**: Role directly involves your core skills
- **Medium match**: Role is adjacent to your experience
- **Low match**: Role requires significant skills you lack

### Step 4: Deduplicate & Store

1. Add ALL fetched jobs (new and skipped) to `seen_jobs.json` with structure:
```json
{
  "seen": {
    "<url_or_company_title_key>": {
      "title": "...",
      "company": "...",
      "url": "...",
      "first_seen": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "fit": "high/medium/low",
      "status": "new/skipped/evaluated/ranked/expired"
    }
  }
}
```

`/rank` extends this schema additively: ranked entries also carry `rank_score` (0–100 overall score), `rank_verdict` (fit band, e.g. "strong fit"), and `rank_date` (ISO date of ranking). The `status` field is set to `"ranked"`. Do not drop these fields when re-writing entries.

2. Only present jobs NOT already in the seen list or tracker.

### Step 5: Present Results

Present new jobs in a table sorted by fit (high first):

```
## New Job Matches - YYYY-MM-DD

Found X new positions (Y high, Z medium, W low match).

| # | Fit | Title | Company | Location | Deadline | URL |
|---|-----|-------|---------|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | High | ... | ... | ... | ... | [Link](...) |

### High-Match Highlights
For each high-match job, add 2-3 bullet points:
- Why it matches your profile
- Key requirements to check
- Any red flags
```

After presenting, ask:
> "Want me to evaluate any of these in detail? Just give me the number(s)."

If the user picks a number, invoke the **job-application-assistant** skill workflow (fit evaluation first, then CV + cover letter if approved).

If the run found many new jobs (roughly 8+), also suggest `/rank` - it batch-scores all new postings against the full fit framework and returns a ranked shortlist, which beats eyeballing a long table. (`/rank` sets the `ranked` and `expired` status values in `seen_jobs.json`; treat both as already-seen for dedup purposes.)

### Step 6: Update Tracker (Optional)

If the user decides to apply to any job, add a row to `job_search_tracker.csv`.

## Important Rules

1. **Never fabricate job postings.** Only present jobs from actual CLI search/detail output or WebSearch/WebFetch results.
2. **Respect deduplication.** Always check seen_jobs.json AND job_search_tracker.csv before presenting.
3. **Focus on configured geographic area.** Skip jobs that require relocation or are clearly outside commute range.
4. **Only open positions.** Skip postings with expired deadlines or those marked as closed.
5. **Be efficient with detail fetches.** Don't run `detail` or WebFetch on every search hit — pre-filter by title/snippet, then fetch only promising matches.
6. **Parallel searches.** Run portal CLI searches in parallel; use WebSearch only for gaps the CLIs don't cover.
