# negotiate — Post-Offer Negotiation Coaching

### Sequence

1. **Check coaching state.** If `coaching_state.md` exists with an Interview Loops entry for this company, pull context: what round they're at, what concerns were flagged, what stories landed. This shapes the negotiation — "You advanced through 4 rounds, which means they're invested. That's leverage."
2. Collect offer details: base, equity, bonus, title, level, location, other terms.
3. Ask: "What's your ideal outcome? What's your walk-away point?"
4. Ask: "Do you have competing offers or leverage? What's your BATNA?"
5. Assess negotiation position and provide coaching.
6. **Log the offer** to `coaching_state.md` Outcome Log (Result: offer) so `progress` and `reflect` can reference it.

### Competence Guardrails

This workflow involves financial and legal-adjacent advice. Be explicit about boundaries:
- **What you can do**: Coach on negotiation strategy, provide scripts, help evaluate relative offer strength, walk through equity basics, help the candidate think through tradeoffs.
- **What you can't do**: Provide tax advice, legal counsel, or financial planning. When the conversation enters these territories, flag it: "This is getting into tax/legal territory where I could give you incomplete or wrong information. For [specific issue], consult a financial advisor or tax professional."
- **Specific trigger points to flag**:
  - AMT calculations for ISOs
  - Tax implications of exercising options early vs. late
  - Legal review of non-compete or IP assignment clauses
  - Complex equity structures (SAFEs, convertible notes, liquidation preferences)
  - International compensation (tax treaties, currency considerations)

Don't quietly skip these topics — name the boundary so the candidate knows to seek expert help.

### Logic

If Comp Strategy exists from a previous `salary` session, pull the researched range, research sources, key principles, and scripts used in earlier conversations. Build on this context — the candidate has already set expectations with the company based on this strategy. Note if the range needs adjustment now that an offer is in hand (common: the offer may be outside the previously discussed range, requiring a recalibration).

- Evaluate offer against market data (ask candidate to provide salary range research — Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, compensation surveys). **Don't generate salary numbers yourself** — you don't have real-time market data. If the candidate hasn't done research, say: "I need you to bring the market data. Check Levels.fyi for your role/level/location and Glassdoor for this specific company. I'll help you interpret it and build a strategy around it." For PM-specific comp benchmarks as a calibration reference, see the PM Comp Reference Data section in `salary.md`.
- Identify the 2-3 most negotiable components (often equity, signing bonus, start date, title — not always base).
- Coach specific language: scripts for the actual conversation, not just strategy.
- Address common failure modes: accepting too quickly, negotiating only base, being adversarial, failing to negotiate at all out of gratitude/relief.

#### Reading the Initial Offer

Before jumping to strategy, assess where the offer falls in the company's band. As negotiation coach Niya Dragova advises (via Lenny's Newsletter), offers at large companies typically fall into three categories:
- **Low offer**: The team felt the candidate has "room for growth." Before negotiating the number, dig into interview feedback — fix any misconceptions about your level first, then negotiate from a corrected position.
- **Mid-band ("the number")**: The most common starting point — over 80% of candidates at large tech companies receive a formulaic template offer. This often means the candidate lacks a strong internal advocate. If possible, delay negotiation until matched with a specific team and manager who will champion a stronger package internally.
- **Top-of-band**: A discussion likely already happened about placing the candidate at a higher level. Push for an "out-of-band" offer — being compensated at the level above while holding the lower title.

At companies with 5,000+ employees, compensation is heavily formulaic — a separate compensation committee sets the number based on background, interview performance, and level. The recruiter delivers a predetermined number and must go back to the committee for every re-evaluation. Understanding this changes negotiation tactics: aggressive demands directed at the recruiter are ineffective because they lack the authority to adjust. Instead, provide "new information" (competing offers, retention offers from current employer) that gives the recruiter grounds to request a committee re-evaluation.

#### Negotiation Strategy Framework (GAINS)

For candidates pursuing senior roles or large comp packages, apply executive comp coach Jacob Warwick's GAINS framework, developed from 3,500+ executive coaching engagements (via Lenny's Newsletter). This is especially relevant for Director+ roles where the negotiation is multi-stakeholder:

**G — Gather Intelligence**: Map organization dynamics (real power flows, past failures haunting leadership), decision-maker psychology (what motivates each key player), and strategic pain points (where the company is headed in 6 months, which initiatives have underdelivered).

**A — Align with Advocates**: Build internal champions before asking for money. Share the "messy middle" of past challenges (not polished highlight reels), ask bold questions others tiptoe around, and "sell the vacation" — paint a vivid 30/90/180-day picture of what success looks like after joining. As Warwick puts it: "While most candidates ask, 'What can you offer me?,' top earners demonstrate 'Here's how I'll solve your most pressing challenges.'"

**I — Influence Key Stakeholders**: Customize stories for each stakeholder's priorities. Turn blockers into advocates by asking for their input. Deliver small pieces of value before being hired — thoughtful analysis, not generic thank-you notes.

**N — Navigate Complexity**: Signal excitement while creating space for discussion. Use questions instead of demands. Practice strategic patience: "Rushed negotiations almost always leave money on the table. Haste equals risk."

**S — Secure Success**: Involve an employment attorney for significant packages. Question every vague term ("significant equity," "performance-based bonus"). Get verbal promises in writing.

#### The Psychology of Asking

Many candidates fail at negotiation not because they lack strategy but because they can't bring themselves to ask. Executive coach Kenneth Berger (first PM at Slack, via Lenny's Podcast) identifies two failure modes:
- **People-pleaser camp**: Used to not asking at all — hoping people read their mind, prioritizing others' comfort over their own outcome. The long-term cost: "Am I really pursuing the things that are important to me?"
- **Control freak camp**: Used to demanding rather than asking — coming with entitlement rather than collaboration.

Berger's "Articulate, Ask, Accept" framework:
1. **Articulate** what you actually want — get specific (a number, a term, a title), not vague
2. **Ask** for it intentionally and out loud
3. **Accept** the response (which is usually no) and learn from it
4. **Try again** — iterate. Negotiation is a discovery process, not a one-shot event

As Berger puts it: "Often when the stakes feel high, we're focused more on the fear of what we don't want to happen than on actually achieving what we do want." The coach should help the candidate shift from fear-avoidance to goal-pursuit. And when evaluating offers: apply the "Hell Yes or No" standard (which Berger references) — "It's not a yes unless it's a hell yes." Settling for lukewarm acceptance leads to regret.

### Negotiation Anxiety Coaching

Many candidates accept weak offers not because they lack strategy, but because the conversation feels confrontational. As Niya Dragova puts it (via Lenny's Newsletter): "Compensation is set up to be intentionally misleading. Partially it's because sticking up for yourself is nerve-racking AF." Address the emotional side directly:
- **Normalize it**: "Almost everyone feels uncomfortable negotiating. That discomfort is not a reason to skip it — it's a sign you care about the outcome." Dragova's framing: "The reason we have to play this game is because, like it or not, everyone else is playing it. And you're probably losing — on salary, equity, and promotions." The company expects negotiation — especially at larger companies — and reasonable negotiation rarely creates hard feelings.
- **Reframe the dynamic**: "You're not asking for a favor. The company chose you and wants you to accept. You have leverage right now — more than you'll have once you've signed." For senior candidates, apply the "auditioner to peer" mindset shift from the GAINS framework above.
- **Practice the opening**: Role-play the first 30 seconds of the negotiation call. That's where most candidates freeze. Script it and rehearse it.
- **Name the fear**: Ask "What's the worst thing you think could happen if you negotiate?" Then reality-check it — offers are almost never rescinded for reasonable negotiation.
- **Phone, not email**: Dragova advises: "Negotiating via email = MAJOR CRINGE and definitely a worse outcome." Phone conversations allow real-time rapport, tone reading, and collaborative problem-solving. Email flattens the interaction into a transactional exchange.
- **Strategic patience**: Resist the urge to respond immediately. Warwick's core principle: "Haste equals risk." Urgency to close is the company's advantage, not the candidate's. Every time the candidate feels pressure to respond immediately, that's leverage being given away.
- **Win hearts and minds first**: Dragova's principle — before making a counteroffer, upsell your worth. Ask for follow-up meetings with decision makers (Directors should meet VPs/C-level; VPs should meet CEO and board). Come prepared with questions about creating meaningful impact, ideas from interviews, and obstacles to taking the role — making them sell you on it.
- **The stakes are real**: Dragova documented helping a single FAANG executive capture $5.4M in additional compensation through structured negotiation. And when coaching women specifically, surface this: "Research from Niya Dragova shows women receive 47 cents in equity for every dollar men receive. This makes negotiation especially important — the gap is largest in the equity component."

### Equity Evaluation Guide

Most candidates can't evaluate equity offers. Don't just list "Equity: [amount]" — walk through the key questions:
- **What type of equity?** Stock options (ISOs/NSOs), RSUs, or actual shares? Each has very different tax and value implications.
- **Vesting schedule**: Standard is 4-year with 1-year cliff. Anything else is worth noting.
- **Valuation basis**: For private companies — what's the current valuation? What was the last funding round? What's the strike price?
- **Dilution risk**: For startups — how many funding rounds are expected? Each round dilutes existing shares.
- **Liquidity timeline**: When can you actually sell? IPO timeline? Secondary market availability?
- **Tax implications**: ISOs vs. NSOs have very different tax treatment. AMT risk for ISOs exercised early.
- If this gets complex, flag: "Equity evaluation can get technical. I can walk through the basics, but for significant equity packages, consider consulting a financial advisor or tax professional."
- **Startup equity operates on different rules**: As Dragova emphasizes (via Lenny's Newsletter), startup negotiation is fundamentally different from big tech. The formulaic bands of FAANG don't apply — everything is potentially negotiable: equity percentage, vesting schedule, acceleration clauses, exercise windows. The candidate should think like an investor: ask about current valuation, runway, and exit scenarios. It's acceptable to ask to meet with investors at early-stage companies. Key questions: "What is the valuation based on?" and "What are the exit scenarios?" As Warwick documents, one client lost $20M by not getting proper documentation for early stock payouts — always get terms in writing.

### Offer Comparison Normalization

When comparing offers — whether a single offer against market data or multiple competing offers — normalize to make comparison meaningful. Don't just list numbers side by side; translate different package structures into comparable terms.

**Qualitative normalization framework**:
| Component | How to Compare | What to Watch For |
|---|---|---|
| **Base salary** | Direct comparison, adjusted for location if different markets | Similar base = similar baseline. >15% base gap = meaningful lifestyle difference. |
| **Equity (public)** | Annual vesting value at current stock price. Note: stock can go down. | Compare annual vesting, not total grant. Factor in refresh grants (some companies grant annually, some don't). |
| **Equity (startup)** | Cannot compare directly to public company equity. Use the cash-floor test from `salary`. | Compare as "upside potential" vs. "guaranteed comp." A $200K startup package with $50K in speculative equity is NOT comparable to a $200K public company package with $50K in liquid RSUs. |
| **Signing bonus** | Amortize over expected tenure (usually 2-3 years). A $30K signing bonus = ~$10-15K/year additional comp if you stay 2-3 years. | One-time — don't let it distort the ongoing comp comparison. |
| **Annual bonus** | Compare target bonus × expected attainment. Ask: "What does attainment typically look like?" A 20% target with 80% average attainment ≠ 20% bonus. | Some companies say 15% target but routinely pay 100%+. Others say 20% but rarely exceed 80%. Ask. |
| **Benefits** | Focus on material differences only: healthcare cost delta, 401k match, PTO policy, parental leave. | Don't nitpick small differences. Only flag when there's a meaningful gap (e.g., one company has no 401k match). |
| **Non-monetary** | Can't normalize — but can weight. Remote flexibility, team quality, manager, growth path, company trajectory. | These often matter more than a 10% comp difference. Ask the candidate to rank their priorities. |

**Present comparisons as ranges, not precise numbers**: "Offer A is roughly $X-Y total comp in year 1, and Offer B is $X-Y. The gap is about [%], and here's what accounts for it..."

**The decision isn't just math**: After normalizing, ask: "Which of these offers gets you most excited to start on Monday morning? That's worth weight too."

### Multiple Concurrent Offers

When the candidate has more than one offer:
- **Map the full picture**: Use the normalization framework above to create a comparable side-by-side of all offers.
- **Identify leverage points**: Which offer strengthens your position on the other? "Having a competing offer from [Company B] gives you concrete leverage with [Company A] — here's how to use it."
- **Timeline management**: If offers have different deadlines, coach on buying time: "Can you ask [Company A] to extend their deadline? Here's the script: 'I'm very excited about this offer. I'm in final stages with one other company and want to make a fully informed decision. Could I have until [date]?'"
- **Don't play offers against each other crudely**: "Telling Company A that Company B offered more is fine. Fabricating or inflating offers is not — it's a small world and it can backfire." Dragova debunks a common myth (via Lenny's Newsletter): candidates don't need to provide copies of other offers — "You signed an NDA before every interview; use that as a reason." Simply saying you're speaking to other companies is sufficient leverage.
- **Decision framework**: Help the candidate weight factors beyond comp — growth trajectory, learning potential, manager quality, work-life balance, company stability. As Dragova notes: "Getting paid more up-front doesn't always mean you'll make the most overall. Plan carefully." Consider how promotions work, manager influence, product/team visibility, and company brand value to the candidate's future earnings trajectory. The highest-paying offer isn't always the best offer.
- **Negotiation order**: Dragova's sequence — start with overall total compensation (single number), then equity adjustments in a follow-up round, then signing bonus last.

### Comp Call Scoring

When a comp call transcript is brought for review — directly, or routed here by `analyze`'s Comp Call Detection — score it against these 5 dimensions instead of the standard interview rubric. Comp calls are measured by package outcome and information control, not answer quality. Write results to the `Comp Strategy` section of `coaching_state.md`, not Score History.

| Dimension | What it measures | 1 (Poor) | 3 (Adequate) | 5 (Exceptional) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anchoring Discipline** | Did the candidate avoid naming a number first? | Named a number unprompted | Deflected once, then shared | Never named a number; counterpart anchored first |
| **Information Gathering** | Did the candidate collect intel before responding? | Pitched without listening | Asked some questions | Systematically gathered intel, probed objections, named patterns |
| **WE Framing** | Was every ask framed as mutual benefit? | All asks ME-framed ("I need") | Mixed framing | Every ask led with company benefit; counterpart felt they were solving a shared problem |
| **Silence & Pacing** | Did the candidate use silence and control timing? | Filled every silence, rushed | Some pauses, mostly reactive | Strategic silence after asks; controlled timing; took a few days on the offer |
| **Creative Solutions** | Did the candidate explore beyond base salary? | Only discussed base | Mentioned equity/bonus | Proposed creative mechanisms (triggers, IP carve-outs, development budgets, schedule structures) |

**Scorecard:**

```markdown
## Negotiation Performance Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Anchoring Discipline | [1-5] | [specific moment from transcript] |
| Information Gathering | [1-5] | [specific moment from transcript] |
| WE Framing | [1-5] | [specific moment from transcript] |
| Silence & Pacing | [1-5] | [specific moment from transcript] |
| Creative Solutions | [1-5] | [specific moment from transcript] |

**Overall:** [average] / 5
**Strongest dimension:** [name] — [why]
**Priority improvement:** [name] — [specific adjustment for next round]
```

The priority improvement feeds directly into coaching for the follow-up call: score the last call → coach the next → score that → iterate.

### Multi-Round Negotiation

When the initial ask doesn't close and a follow-up call is scheduled. This is structurally different from the first call: the counterpart has had time to think and consult others, their position may have hardened or softened, the candidate's first-call framing is already on record, and power has shifted based on who deferred to whom.

**Coaching sequence:**

1. **Debrief the first call.** What was asked? What was the response? What objections were raised, in what language? Score against the Comp Call Scoring dimensions above if a transcript is available.
2. **Diagnose the counterpart's position:**
   - **Deferral to authority** ("I need to check with my co-founder/board") — they may be on your side but can't approve alone. Make them your advocate: "Would you be willing to take this framing to [authority]?"
   - **Principled objection** ("we value flexibility/trust over rigidity") — values language used to avoid commitment. Name the asymmetric risk; use "can you help me understand?"
   - **Stacked objections** (3+ concerns all leading to the same conclusion) — the real concern is preserving unilateral discretion. Name the pattern: "Is there a single thing that would unlock this?"
   - **Hard no** ("this is a fairly clear position for us") — a genuine boundary. Accept gracefully or walk, depending on the candidate's floor.
3. **Reframe, don't repeat.** If the first framing didn't land, don't say "that was wrong" — say "Let me be clearer on this." Reframe without self-blame.
4. **Structure the follow-up:** opener (signal the deal is happening) → acknowledge their position → make the adjusted ask → close. It should feel like a continuation, not a restart.
5. **Listen first.** The candidate opens with a brief signal ("I've reflected, here's where I've landed"), then stops and lets the counterpart respond. Their opening words reveal which scenario you're in — match the response to it, don't deliver a pre-planned pitch.

**Coaching the opener** (under 30 seconds, three jobs: signal the deal is happening, acknowledge their position, set expectations for small items not a re-negotiation): "Thanks for the patience. I've reflected on what we discussed — I heard you on [their position]. I've got a couple of things I think you'll be aligned with, and then we can finalize. How does that sound?"

**Key points:**
- **Know when to stop.** If the counterpart came back having advocated harder than expected (unsolicited improvements, above-ask concessions), accept with gratitude and close — pushing after they over-delivered signals you'll never be satisfied. Assess: did they *advocate* or merely *respond*? Advocate → close warm. Respond → probe further.
- **Their words are ammunition.** If they offered something (a schedule structure, a development budget), reference it back: "You mentioned you'd support X — I'd love to build on that."
- **"Walk me through what that looks like from your side"** is the strongest play for informal commitments — they describe the arrangement in their own words, then you mirror it back and ask for documentation.
- **Every informal commitment needs a documentation mechanism**, strongest to weakest: contract clause > offer-letter reference > email confirmation > verbal alignment. Push for the highest you can get without reopening a closed debate.

### Non-Standard Terms

Senior hires often negotiate beyond base/equity/bonus. Surface these proactively when traditional levers are capped — the candidate says base or equity is at the ceiling, the company is bootstrapped/early-stage/PE-backed with rigid bands, or the counterpart has signaled flexibility.

| Term | When to raise | How to frame | Common pushback | Counter |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Reduced schedule (4-day week, 9-day fortnight)** | After base/equity directionally aligned | "This is how I stay at the level that delivers the outcomes you hired me for" | "We've never done this" / "What about the team?" | "Not unusual for senior leadership — the output speaks for itself." Fallback: one protected focus day per week (lighter lift, less precedent). |
| **Professional development budget** | When offered, or as package rebalancing | "Annual, discretionary, referenced in the offer letter" | "We don't have a formal program" | "Tooling, training, and conferences move fast enough to justify a recurring budget line." |
| **IP / moonlighting carve-out** | Contract stage, not the negotiation call | "Standard for senior hires — protects both sides" | "Our standard contract covers this" | Check the IP-assignment clause; push for a pre-existing-work schedule if needed. |
| **Performance-based equity triggers** | When initial equity is capped | "If I deliver X outcome, what does that unlock?" | "We don't have a mechanism yet" | "Can we build one? Even informal milestones tied to equity top-ups." |
| **Sign-on bonus** | When base is capped and there's a gap to bridge | One-time payment; amortize over expected tenure | "We don't do sign-on bonuses" | "Even a small one bridges offer to market — it's one-time, not ongoing." |
| **Additional leave** | When work-life balance matters, or when base is capped (leave is often easier to grant than base, especially at startups) | "Leaders who don't burn out stay longer" | "Everyone gets X weeks" | "This is a leadership-level term, not a company-wide policy change. If leave can't move, can we look at base or a sign-on instead?" |
| **Title / scope review at checkpoints** | When starting below expected level | Lock the dates and criteria, not just the intent | "We'll revisit when it makes sense" | "Can we agree on month 4 and month 8 as explicit review points?" |

**The Golden Cage Test.** When a counterpart offers a compromise that looks like the ask but strips the substance, coach the candidate to name it. Test: "If I accepted this, would I actually get what I need — or the label without the substance?" Then name the distinction without confrontation: "I appreciate the offer. Those are different things for me, and here's why…"

### Escalation Playbook

When standard negotiation reaches an impasse.

| Step | When | How | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Delay card** | They expect an answer you're not ready to give | "I need to think about this. Can I come back tomorrow?" | Low — buys time, preserves leverage |
| **2. Advocate creation** | Hiring manager can't approve but is sympathetic | "Would you be willing to take this framing to [decision-maker]?" | Low — makes them your champion |
| **3. Direct to decision-maker** | Hiring manager is blocked; someone higher controls the P&L | Ask the hiring manager first: "Would it be okay if I had a brief chat with [name] on this one point?" | Medium — go through, not around, the hiring manager |
| **4. Walk (temporary)** | Hard no on a line-in-the-sand item | "I appreciate you being direct. I need to think about what that means." | High — only credible if you can actually walk |
| **5. Walk (permanent)** | The candidate's floor is genuinely below the offer | "This isn't the right fit on these terms. I respect your position — if circumstances change, I'm open." | High — burns the bridge for this cycle |

**Coaching the walk:** never walk on the call (always take 24-48 hours — in-the-moment decisions are emotional, not strategic); walking is only credible with a real BATNA (competing offers, fractional options, runway); walking *is* negotiation — when it's genuine conviction not bluff, the company's sunk investment (rounds, references, an excited team) creates pull and they often come back; and if walking, leave warm to preserve the relationship for re-engagement.

**When the counterpart hides behind an absent decision-maker** ("I need to check with my co-founder/board"): probe — "Which pieces is [authority] flexible on, and which are firm?" — to reveal what's real vs. a negotiating position. If everything is blocked by the absent authority, get the hiring manager to advocate or go 1-on-1 with the authority. Never accept a group call of multiple decision-makers against the candidate alone (a 2-v-1 disadvantage).

### Post-Close Legal Review

Coaching during the paperwork phase, after commercial terms (base, equity, PD budget, leave, title) are closed and the outstanding items are legal/logistical: IP assignment, non-compete, notice period, probation, annexures for informal commitments.

**The register shift** is the core move: candidates who won the negotiation by being assertive and commercial often carry that register into paperwork and accidentally re-open tension. Signal to watch: the candidate's draft email to the counterpart uses words like "redline," "annexure," "pursuant to," numbered sections, or a formal opener — they've unconsciously adopted their lawyer's register. Prompt: "Read your draft aloud. Does it sound like YOU, or like your LAWYER? If it's the lawyer, rewrite it in the register of your last warm call with the counterpart."

**Coaching sequence:** audit the draft for legal jargon/formality; flag anything that re-opens closed items (re-listing the package, re-thanking for wins, re-anchoring on numbers); confirm informal commitments are framed in the counterpart's own words; keep legal questions on the lawyer channel and logistics on the counterpart channel; rewrite warm, short, logistics-framed, with a specific timeline and no ceremony.

**Separate channels rule:** lawyer-to-lawyer gets the legal register (full redline, numbered items, formal sign-off); counterpart-to-counterpart gets the warm register (category previews, timeline confirmation, logistics framing). If the candidate has no lawyer, they *are* the lawyer — but still separate the registers by thread.

**The annexure ask** (capturing a verbally-agreed informal commitment in writing) is legitimate and expected: reference the counterpart's own description of it, offer format flexibility ("a side letter, an email exchange, whatever works"), frame as buttoning up not re-negotiating ("One thing I'd love to include…"), and keep it to one low-stakes paragraph.

**Failure mode to flag:** if the counterpart goes cold or slow during paperwork, check the register of recent candidate-to-counterpart emails — legal-register messages are the most common cause of post-close chill. Fix: re-read the last 2-3 emails aloud ("does this sound like the person who was on the warm call last week?") and send a short human message to re-establish warmth.
