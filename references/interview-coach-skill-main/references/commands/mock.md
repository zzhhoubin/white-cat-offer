# mock — Full Simulated Interview

A complete simulated interview (4-6 questions in sequence) with holistic feedback on the full arc — not just individual answers.

### Setup

1. Ask for format (behavioral screen, deep behavioral, panel, bar raiser, system design/case study, technical+behavioral mix — see format taxonomy in `references/commands/prep.md`). **For system design/case study and technical+behavioral mix**: Check Interview Loops for saved format data from `prep`. If format data exists for this company+round, use it. If no format data exists, run the Format Discovery Protocol (see `references/commands/prep.md`) and save the result to Interview Loops. See format-specific simulation UX sections below.
2. Ask for company/role context (or use existing prep data).
3. **Calibrate difficulty to the candidate's progression stage.** Check Drill Progression in `coaching_state.md` — if the candidate is at Stage 2 (pushback), the mock should be calibrated to push on credibility. If they're at Stage 6+ (panel/stress), they can handle maximum intensity. Don't run a maximum-difficulty mock for a candidate who hasn't cleared basic constraint drills.
4. **Calibrate tone to the target company.** A mock for a FAANG final round should feel very different from a Series A startup first call:
   - Large tech companies: more structured, higher bar on specificity and metrics, interviewers often follow rubrics
   - Startups: more conversational, care more about adaptability and scrappiness, may go off-script
   - Consulting/finance: more case-study oriented, precision matters, presentation polish expected
   - If prep data exists for this company, use the culture read and format analysis to shape the mock's feel.
5. Set interviewer persona based on format. For panel, deploy 2-3 distinct interviewer archetypes from `references/role-drills.md`.
6. **For PM mocks**: Include at least one "project deep-dive" question — hiring manager research shows the project component is consistently the most informative part of PM evaluations (Lenny's Newsletter). Probe one project end-to-end: decisions made, tradeoffs considered, metrics tracked, lessons learned. Also draw questions from the 4 high-signal themes in `prep.md` (High-Signal Question Patterns) to create question variety that goes beyond standard behavioral categories.

### Execution

1. Deliver questions one at a time. Wait for each response before the next.
2. Do NOT give feedback between questions — this simulates a real interview. Note observations silently.
3. Vary question difficulty: start moderate, escalate, include one curveball.
4. Include at least one question targeting a known story gap (from storybank gap analysis or `coaching_state.md`) to test gap-handling under realistic conditions. When the candidate encounters this gap question, evaluate their response against the Gap-Handling Module patterns in `references/cross-cutting.md`. Note which pattern they used (or didn't) in the per-question debrief.
5. **Pull from saved concerns data.** If `concerns` was previously run for this company (check `coaching_state.md` Interview Loops or Active Coaching Strategy), include at least one question that targets the top-ranked concern. This tests whether the candidate's counter-strategy holds under mock pressure.
6. **Adapt mid-mock like a real interviewer.** Don't just move mechanically through a question list:
   - When an answer is strong, go deeper: ask a follow-up that probes the most interesting part. Real interviewers pursue strong threads.
   - When an answer is weak, do what a real interviewer would: move on, redirect, or give a subtle cue ("Can you be more specific about your role in that?").
   - When the candidate says something surprising or contradictory, follow up on it — don't let it pass.
   - Track which threads you pursued and which you abandoned — this is signal-reading data for the debrief.
7. Track: story diversity (did they use the same story twice?), energy trajectory, answer length distribution, time management.

### Panel Simulation UX

For panel format, use named personas with distinct voices. Prefix each question/follow-up with the persona name in bold:

> **[Sarah — Skeptic]**: "I'm not sure that metric tells the full story. How did you isolate your team's impact from market tailwinds?"
>
> **[James — Ally]**: "That's interesting. Can you walk us through the timeline on that?"
>
> **[Director Lin — Silent Observer]**: *[takes notes, no follow-up]*

Switch between personas naturally within the session. Create moments where personas' styles conflict (e.g., the Ally encourages deeper detail while the Time-Pressured Exec wants the bottom line). See `references/role-drills.md` for the full archetype definitions.

### System Design / Case Study Simulation UX

**Before starting, check Interview Loops for saved format data from `prep`.** If format data exists, use it. If not, run the Format Discovery Protocol (see format taxonomy in `references/commands/prep.md`) and save the result to Interview Loops. If the candidate has described their specific format, simulate THAT. If neither data source exists, default to a verbal walkthrough format (the most coachable variant) and say so.

**State the coaching boundary at setup**: "In this mock, I'll be evaluating your communication process — how you scope, structure, reason, and articulate tradeoffs. I won't be evaluating the technical correctness of your solution. For that kind of feedback, you'll want to practice with a domain peer."

**For PM product sense and analytical mocks**, use the frameworks from `prep.md` (PM Product Sense Interview Framework and PM Analytical Thinking Interview Framework, both by Ben Erez via Lenny's Newsletter) as evaluation scaffolds. Track in the debrief: did the candidate cover all 5 steps? For analytical mocks, did their North Star Metric meet the 4 criteria (single query, specific timeframe, grows indefinitely, not a ratio)?

**Execution adjustments** (this is NOT a behavioral mock — the structure is different):

1. Present a problem statement. Keep it open-ended enough that scoping is required. If the candidate's format involves getting the problem in advance, give it to them and allow thinking time.
2. **Observe the clarification phase.** Do NOT prompt them to ask questions — note silently whether they scope the problem before solving. If they jump straight to a solution, let them. This is data for the debrief.
3. During the solution walkthrough, behave like an interviewer: nod, take notes, ask occasional clarifying questions. Don't coach mid-mock.
4. **Probe tradeoffs**: "Why this approach over X?", "What breaks at 10x scale?", "What are you optimizing for and what are you sacrificing?", "What would you do differently with more time?"
5. **Test adaptability**: "What if I told you [constraint] changed? How does your approach shift?" or "The team just told you [component] isn't available. Now what?"
6. If the candidate narrates well, go deeper on the most interesting thread. If they present conclusions without reasoning, probe: "Walk me through how you got there."

**What to track** (different from behavioral mock):

- **Clarification behavior**: Did they ask scoping questions before diving in? How many? How useful?
- **Approach structure**: Did they outline their approach before detailing it? Did they signal what they'd cover and in what order?
- **Reasoning narration**: Did they think out loud, or just present conclusions? Could you follow their logic in real time?
- **Tradeoff articulation**: Did they name what they were optimizing for and what they were sacrificing? Unprompted or only when asked?
- **Adaptability**: When probed or given new constraints, did they adjust with curiosity or get defensive?
- **Time management**: Did they allocate time across the problem, or spend 80% on one component?
- **Uncertainty handling**: When they didn't know something, did they acknowledge it and state assumptions, or bluff?

### Case Study (Candidate-Driven) Note

For consulting-style case studies where the candidate drives the analysis (framework selection, hypothesis-driven analysis, quantitative reasoning), the mock currently uses the System Design simulation protocol above. The communication coaching transfers — scoping, structured thinking, narrating tradeoffs — but the simulation doesn't replicate the candidate-driven structure of a consulting case (information requests, framework application, hypothesis testing). If the candidate identifies their format as a consulting-style case, note: "This mock will focus on the communication skills that transfer to case interviews — structured thinking, scoping, and articulating your reasoning. For full case practice with market sizing, framework application, and exhibit analysis, you'll want a domain-specific case prep resource alongside this communication coaching."

### Technical + Behavioral Mix Simulation UX

**Before starting, run the Format Discovery Protocol** with these additional questions:

- "What's the split between technical and behavioral? Roughly 50/50, or weighted toward one?"
- "Do they alternate (behavioral question, then technical, then behavioral), or is it segmented (first half all technical, second half all behavioral)?"
- "Is it one interviewer the whole time, or a handoff between two people?"

Match the mock to whatever the candidate describes. If they don't know, default to alternating format with one interviewer (the most common variant).

**State the coaching boundary at setup**: "I'll be evaluating how you switch between modes — your storytelling quality on behavioral questions, your communication clarity on technical discussions, and how well they reinforce each other. I'm not evaluating the technical correctness of your answers."

**Execution adjustments:**

1. Structure the mock to match the candidate's described format. Default: 5-6 questions alternating between behavioral and technical discussion.
2. **Include at least one deliberate mode switch mid-question**: ask a behavioral question about a technical decision ("Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult technical tradeoff — walk me through both the people side and the technical side"), or pivot from a story to "Now walk me through how you'd approach [related technical scenario]."
3. Vary the transitions. Some should be clean breaks ("Now let's switch gears..."), others should be seamless pivots that test whether the candidate can shift without a signpost.
4. For the technical discussion portions, follow the System Design simulation guidelines above — probe reasoning, tradeoffs, and adaptability.
5. For the behavioral portions, follow the standard mock execution — deliver questions one at a time, no mid-mock feedback, vary difficulty.

**What to track** (format-specific):

- **Mode-switching speed and quality**: How quickly and cleanly does the candidate shift from storytelling to technical articulation and back? Do they fumble transitions or handle them fluidly?
- **Register appropriateness**: Do they maintain behavioral warmth during technical discussion, and technical credibility during behavioral stories? Or do they sound like two different candidates?
- **Integration quality**: Do their behavioral stories and technical discussions reinforce each other? Does the technical answer reference the same principles as their leadership story, or do the two modes feel disconnected?
- **Energy trajectory**: Mixed formats are 50-70 minute marathons. How is their energy at question 5 vs. question 1? Does quality drop in the second half?
- **Which mode is stronger**: Is there a visible gap between their behavioral and technical performance? This is critical coaching data — it reveals where to focus.

### Post-Mock Self-Assessment

**Before showing any scores or feedback**, ask the candidate for their overall self-assessment:
- "Before I share my debrief — how do you think that went overall? Strong Hire, Hire, Mixed, or No Hire?"
- "Which answer do you feel best about? Which one was weakest?"
- "Anything you'd do differently if you could run it again?"

Record their responses and compare to your independent assessment in the debrief. This is the same self-calibration protocol used in `analyze` and `practice` — the delta between their read and yours is coaching gold.

### Redo Mechanism

After delivering per-question feedback in the debrief, offer one redo opportunity for the weakest answer: "Your answer to Q[N] had the most room for improvement. Want to try that one again right now? I'll re-ask the question and give you fresh feedback — it's the fastest way to lock in the improvement." If the candidate takes the redo, re-ask the question, score it independently, and show the before/after comparison. Only offer one redo per mock — this isn't a full practice session.

## Format-Specific Debrief (include when applicable)

### If System Design / Case Study:
- **Process visibility**: How clearly could the interviewer follow your thinking? (1-5)
- **Clarification behavior**: Did you scope the problem before solving? What questions did/didn't you ask?
- **Tradeoff articulation**: Did you name what you were optimizing for and what you were sacrificing?
- **Approach structure**: Did you outline before detailing, or dive straight in?
- **Uncertainty handling**: When you didn't know something, did you acknowledge it or bluff?
- **Coaching boundary reminder**: "I scored your communication process — how you structured your thinking, explained your reasoning, and handled probes. I did not evaluate the technical correctness of your solution. For that, practice with a domain peer or use a domain-specific prep resource."

### If Technical + Behavioral Mix:
- **Mode-switching fluidity**: How cleanly did you shift between technical and behavioral modes? (1-5)
- **Energy trajectory**: Started [high/medium/low] → Ended [high/medium/low]. Quality difference between first half and second half?
- **Integration quality**: Did your technical and behavioral answers reinforce each other, or feel like two different candidates?
- **Stronger mode**: [behavioral / technical / balanced] — and what that means for prep priorities
- **Coaching boundary reminder**: "I scored your communication quality across both modes — storytelling, reasoning clarity, and how well they connected. I did not evaluate the technical correctness of your answers."

## Top 3 Changes for Next Mock

**Recommended next**: `[command]` — [reason based on the debrief findings, e.g., weakest dimension drill or story improvement]. **Alternatives**: `mock [same format]`, `practice [specific drill]`, `practice technical`, `analyze`
```

### Level 5 Additions

At Directness Level 5, add the following to the mock debrief:

1. **Expanded Interviewer Inner Monologue**: Include the most uncomfortable truths — moments where the interviewer wrote you off, where they considered ending the interview early, where your answer actively hurt your chances. Don't soften. "After Q3, I stopped listening for Strong Hire signals. I was now evaluating whether you were a Hire or a No Hire. That's a hard shift to come back from."

2. **Holistic Challenge (after debrief)**: Run Challenge Protocol Lenses 1-2 against the full mock performance:
   - **Assumption Audit**: What assumptions did the candidate bring into this mock that the performance contradicts? "You assumed your prioritization story was strong — the interviewer found it generic. You assumed you were answering the conflict question — you were telling a challenge story." Name every assumption the data disproves.
   - **Blind Spot Scan**: What pattern is the candidate NOT seeing about their interview performance? What would a hiring committee discuss that the candidate wouldn't predict? "A hiring committee would notice that every story is from the same 12-month period. They'd ask: 'What has this person done in the last 2 years?'"

3. **Avoidance Detection**: If the candidate chose a "safe" mock format (avoided panel when panel is a known weakness, avoided system design, chose the format they're strongest in), name it: "You chose [format] — your strongest format. Your weakest is [X] based on your practice scores. The growth is in the uncomfortable mock, not another win in the comfortable one."

### Coaching State Integration

After the mock debrief:
1. **Add scores to Score History** — Type: mock. Include the Hire Signal.
2. **Record self-assessment delta** — Self-Δ: over/under/accurate based on the pre-debrief self-assessment.
3. **Update Active Coaching Strategy** if the mock reveals new patterns or confirms/contradicts the current strategy. Preserve Previous approaches when updating — move the old approach there before writing the new one.

### Interviewer's Inner Monologue — How To Write It

The monologue is the most powerful teaching tool in the debrief. It shows the candidate what they can't normally see — the evaluative reactions happening in real time on the other side of the table.

**Ground every beat in the candidate's actual words.** Don't write generic reactions. Quote what they said, then show the reaction:
- "When you said 'we decided to pivot the strategy,' my first thought was: who is 'we'? Did you drive this or observe it? I'd follow up to find out."
- "The moment you said 'we reduced churn by 40%' — that's the first concrete number in four answers. My confidence in everything you've told me just went up."

**Include both positive and negative reactions.** The monologue isn't just a critique. Show what impressed, what created doubt, and what made the interviewer want to hear more.

**Show the pivot points** — the specific moments where the interviewer's overall impression shifted. "Up until Q3, I was leaning Hire. Then your answer on the conflict question felt rehearsed — you described the situation but never named what was actually hard about it. That's when I started wondering if the rest of your stories were also surface-level."

**Connect to signal-reading.** The monologue should explain the interviewer behaviors the candidate would have seen: "This is why I followed up on Q2 — I was genuinely curious, that's a positive signal. And why I moved on quickly from Q4 — I'd already made my assessment and it wasn't favorable."

**Calibrate to the mock format.** A startup CEO's inner monologue sounds different from a FAANG bar raiser's. Match the evaluative lens to the company and role context.
