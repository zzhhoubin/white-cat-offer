# decode — JD Analysis + Batch Triage

### How JDs Actually Work (Reference Knowledge)

**JD Structure Patterns**: JDs follow predictable structures — company intro, role summary, responsibilities, requirements, nice-to-haves, benefits. But the signal isn't in the structure, it's in the language.

**Signal Density by Section**:
- Requirements = screening criteria (ATS + recruiter first pass). What gets you through the door.
- Responsibilities = what the role actually does. Often more honest than requirements.
- Nice-to-haves = the ideal candidate profile. What "Strong Hire" looks like beyond baseline.
- Company intro = culture signals and positioning. How the company wants to be perceived.
- Benefits = comp philosophy signals. Equity-heavy = startup. Benefits-heavy = mature org.

**The 6 Decoding Lenses** (adapted from prep.md's JD Parsing Guide — decode makes these the main event):
1. **Repetition frequency** — Count how often key themes appear. If "cross-functional collaboration" appears 3 times, it is a primary evaluation criterion. Most repeated = most important, regardless of where it appears.
2. **Order and emphasis** — What's listed first in responsibilities/requirements? First = highest priority. The first 3 bullets typically reflect the top 3 evaluation criteria.
3. **Required vs. nice-to-have** — Required = screening criteria that filter you in/out before a human looks. Nice-to-have = what differentiates "Hire" from "Strong Hire." Many candidates skip nice-to-haves — this is a mistake.
4. **Verb choices** — "Own" vs. "support" vs. "contribute to" signal autonomy and scope. "Own end-to-end" is a fundamentally different job from "contribute to team efforts." "Drive" vs. "execute" signals strategy vs. implementation.
5. **Between-the-lines signals** — Euphemisms decoded. "Fast-paced environment" = likely understaffed or rapid change. "Comfortable with ambiguity" = undefined role or early-stage. "Stakeholder management" = political environment. "Wear many hats" = no clear role boundaries. These are interpretations, not facts — confidence-label accordingly.
6. **What's missing** — Absence is information. A PM JD that doesn't mention data/analytics signals team maturity (or lack of PM influence on data). An engineering JD that doesn't mention testing may indicate culture. A senior role with no mention of mentoring signals an IC-heavy org.

**What JDs Don't Tell You** (honest limitations):
- Actual day-to-day work (JDs describe the ideal, not the reality)
- Team dynamics, manager quality, internal politics
- Whether the role is backfill (someone left) vs. new headcount (growth)
- Whether the req is actually open vs. evergreen posting
- Real comp range (unless required by jurisdiction or voluntarily disclosed)
- Internal candidate preference
- Hiring timeline urgency

**Batch Triage Research**:
- Average job search involves 100-200 applications. Hit rate is 2-8%.
- Time per application: 30-90 minutes (resume tailoring, cover letter, research).
- Improving triage accuracy by 20% saves 20-40 hours of application effort.
- Signal: candidates who apply to Strong Fit roles have materially better outcomes than those who spray-and-apply.
- The batch comparison reveals the candidate's "sweet spot" — competencies that recur across JDs they're drawn to — which is itself career intelligence.

### Confidence Labeling System

Every interpretation gets a confidence label. This is non-negotiable — it's what makes decode honest instead of performative.

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **HIGH** | Directly stated in JD, standard industry meaning | "5+ years of Python required" → HIGH: Python is a hard screening criterion |
| **MEDIUM** | Reasonable inference from language patterns or industry norms | "Cross-functional leadership" repeated 3x → MEDIUM: likely the primary evaluation lens |
| **LOW** | Interpretation of ambiguous language, euphemism decoding | "Fast-paced environment" → LOW: may indicate understaffing or rapid change |
| **UNKNOWN** | Cannot determine from JD alone | Team size, reporting structure, actual day-to-day → UNKNOWN |

**Rule**: Every LOW and UNKNOWN interpretation MUST be paired with a specific recruiter verification question. The candidate should never walk away believing a LOW-confidence interpretation is fact.

### Priority Check

- If no `kickoff`: Soft gate — "I can decode the JD's language and structure, but without your profile I can't assess fit. Run `kickoff` first for a fit assessment, or proceed with a general decode?"
- If interview within 48 hours: Redirect to `hype`/`prep`.
- If JD Analysis already exists for this company+role: Show the existing decode and ask if the JD has changed. Don't re-decode unchanged JDs.

### Required Inputs

- At least one JD (pasted text or key details)
- For batch triage: 2-5 JDs

### Optional Inputs

- Depth level: Quick Scan / Standard / Deep Decode (default: Standard)
- Specific questions about the JD
- Target priority (is this a top target or early-stage exploration?)

### Depth Levels

| Level | When to Use | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick Scan** | Fast filter, building a target list, evaluating whether to apply | Top 5 competencies extracted + fit verdict (if Profile exists) + 3 key signals + confidence labels + recruiter verification questions for LOW/UNKNOWN items |
| **Standard** | Default. Full JD analysis. | All 6 lenses + full competency extraction + fit assessment + concern mapping + question-prediction seeds + recruiter verification questions + teaching layer |
| **Deep Decode** | High-priority target, unusual JD, career transition, seniority mismatch | All of Standard + seniority calibration (what level this JD actually targets vs. what it says) + team maturity analysis + JD structural quality assessment + Challenge Protocol (Level 5) |

### Logic / Sequence (7 steps)

**Step 1: JD Intake**
Accept JD in any format — full posting, bullet-point paste, screenshot description, even "here's roughly what the JD says." Parse into sections (responsibilities, requirements, nice-to-haves, etc.). If sections aren't clearly labeled, infer from content. Flag if the JD is unusually short (may be incomplete) or unusually long (may be a kitchen-sink posting).

**Step 2: Context Assembly**
Pull from coaching_state.md: Profile (target role, seniority band), Resume Analysis (skills, experience, positioning strengths), Storybank (skills coverage), Positioning Statement (key differentiator), active Interview Loops (is this company already in progress?), JD Analyses (previous decodes for pattern comparison).

**Step 3: 6-Lens Decode**
Apply all 6 decoding lenses. For each finding:
- State the finding
- Assign confidence label (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/UNKNOWN)
- Provide evidence (what in the JD supports this)
- For MEDIUM/LOW/UNKNOWN: provide the recruiter verification question

Group findings by lens in Standard/Deep output. In Quick Scan, surface only the top 3 highest-signal findings.

For Lens 5 (between-the-lines signals), use the "decode + verify" pattern:
- State the euphemism or signal
- Provide the most likely interpretation
- Label confidence (almost always LOW or MEDIUM)
- Provide the verification question: what to ask, why it matters, how to ask it naturally

For Lens 6 (what's missing), explicitly state what the absence might mean AND what it might not mean. Absence is ambiguous — don't present a single interpretation as truth.

**Step 4: Competency Extraction**
Extract top 5-7 competencies in priority order. For each:
- The competency (specific, not vague)
- Source section(s) (where in the JD it appears)
- Confidence level
- Repetition count (how many times it appears across sections)
- Type: Screening (required, filters in/out) or Differentiating (nice-to-have, separates Hire from Strong Hire)

**Step 5: Fit Assessment (if Profile exists)**
Map extracted competencies against candidate profile. For each competency:
- **Match**: Direct evidence from resume/storybank (cite specific evidence)
- **Partial**: Adjacent experience, frameable with narrative (explain the bridge)
- **Gap**: No evidence, structural gap (name it honestly)
- **Unknown**: Can't assess without more information from candidate

Produce fit verdict using the Role-Fit Assessment from cross-cutting.md (5 dimensions: Requirement Coverage, Seniority Alignment, Domain Relevance, Competency Overlap, Trajectory Coherence). Classify gaps as Frameable (narrative can bridge) or Structural (real limitation).

Verdict: Strong Fit / Investable Stretch / Long-Shot Stretch / Weak Fit

For Long-Shot Stretch and Weak Fit: be honest. "This JD targets [X], and your profile shows [Y]. You could apply, but you should know the gap is structural, not just a framing issue." Don't waste the candidate's time encouraging applications to roles they're not competitive for — unless they have a specific strategy (referral, internal transfer, etc.).

**Step 6: Recruiter Verification Questions**
Compile all MEDIUM, LOW, and UNKNOWN confidence interpretations into a prioritized list of questions to ask the recruiter. For each:
- What you want to verify
- Why it matters for your decision/preparation
- How to ask it naturally (not "your JD said X, what does that mean?" but "Can you tell me more about [topic]?")

Order by impact on the apply/don't-apply decision.

**Step 7: Batch Triage (if multiple JDs provided)**
For each JD: run Steps 1-6 individually (can be abbreviated for Quick Scan depth).

Then produce comparative analysis:
- **Rank by fit** (highest fit first, with evidence for each)
- **Overlapping competencies** across JDs — this reveals the candidate's market-validated sweet spot
- **Divergent requirements** — where JDs pull in different directions, signaling scope decisions the candidate needs to make
- **Allocation recommendation**: which to pursue first, which to skip, which to research more. Honest about skips — "This one is a Long-Shot Stretch because [specific reason]. Unless you have an inside connection, your time is better spent on the others."
- **Target profile synthesis** — what these JDs collectively reveal about what the market wants from someone like the candidate

### Teaching Layer

This is what differentiates decode from prep's JD parsing. Quick Scan includes a lighter version (a single "Decode Tip" — one teaching insight per scan, rotating through the 6 lenses). Standard and Deep include the full "Learn to Read This Yourself" section:
- **Pattern spotted**: A specific decoding insight from THIS JD that the candidate can apply to future JDs (e.g., "Notice how 'drive strategy' appeared in responsibilities but 'execute campaigns' appeared in requirements — the responsibilities describe the aspirational version of the role, the requirements describe the actual bar")
- **Trap to watch for**: A common misread THIS JD exemplifies (e.g., "This JD lists 12 'required' qualifications. No candidate has all 12. In practice, 6-8 match is strong. Don't self-screen out based on a wish list.")
- **Self-decode prompt**: A question the candidate should ask themselves when reading the NEXT JD (rotate through a set: "What verb does the first responsibility use?", "Count how many times 'collaboration' or 'cross-functional' appears", "What's conspicuously absent?")

```markdown
## Batch Triage: [N] Roles

## Ranking
| Rank | Company | Role | Fit | Strongest Match | Biggest Gap | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | ... | Strong | [competency] | [gap or none] | Pursue |
| 2 | ... | ... | Investable Stretch | [competency] | [gap] | Pursue with positioning |
| 3 | ... | ... | Long-Shot Stretch | [competency] | [gap] | Skip unless referral |

## Your Sweet Spot
[Competencies that appear across multiple JDs — this is what the market values in you. Ordered by frequency across JDs.]

## Divergence
[Requirements that pull in different directions — reveals a scope decision the candidate needs to make. E.g., "JDs 1 and 3 want hands-on IC work; JD 2 wants people management. These are different career paths."]

## Allocation Recommendation
- **Pursue first**: [which roles, why — highest fit + highest priority]
- **Pursue with targeted prep**: [which roles, what specific gap to address]
- **Research more before deciding**: [which roles, what's missing]
- **Skip or deprioritize**: [which roles, why — honest about structural gaps]

## Your Market Profile
[What these JDs collectively reveal about what the market wants from someone like the candidate. This is career intelligence, not just job-search tactics.]

**Recommended next**: `research [top-ranked company]` or `prep [top-ranked company]`. **Alternatives**: `decode` with more JDs, `resume` (JD-targeted optimization for top target)
