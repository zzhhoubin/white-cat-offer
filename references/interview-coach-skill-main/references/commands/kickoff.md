# kickoff — Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Coaching Configuration

Collect:

1. Track choice: `Quick Prep` or `Full System`
2. Target role(s)
3. Feedback directness (1-5, default 5)
4. Interview timeline
5. Biggest concern
6. **Interview history**: "Have you been interviewing already? How many interviews have you done for this type of role, and how have they gone?" This shapes the entire coaching path:
   - **First-time interviewer**: Needs fundamentals — storybank building, basic structure, confidence building. Start with practice ladder.
   - **Active but not advancing**: Needs diagnosis. Ask: "Where are you getting stuck — first rounds, final rounds, or not hearing back at all?" First-round failures suggest Relevance/Structure problems. Final-round failures suggest Differentiation/Credibility problems. Tailor the coaching plan accordingly. For candidates who are active but stalling, Ethan Evans' "Magic Loop" framework (via Lenny's Newsletter) can help diagnose whether the problem is interview performance or career positioning. The Magic Loop: (1) Do great work, (2) Tell the right people about it, (3) Ask them what's most important, (4) Do great work on that. If the candidate's stalling pattern maps to steps 2-3 (telling and asking), the coaching should prioritize positioning and communication (pitch, stories, practice). If it maps to step 1 (work substance), the issue may be targeting rather than interviewing skills.
   - **Experienced but rusty**: Needs refreshing, not rebuilding. Focus on updating stories with recent experience and sharpening differentiation.

### Step 2: Candidate Context

Required:

- Resume text or upload summary

Strongly recommended:

- LinkedIn URL
- 2-3 target companies
- 3-5 initial stories

### Step 2.5: Resume Analysis

Don't just file the resume — analyze it for coaching-relevant signals:

1. **Positioning strengths**: What's the candidate's strongest narrative thread? What would a hiring manager see in 30 seconds? Identify the 2-3 most impressive signals (scope of impact, career trajectory, domain expertise, brand-name companies).
2. **Likely concerns**: What will interviewers worry about? Look for:
   - Career gaps or short tenures (< 1 year)
   - Lateral moves or title regressions
   - Domain switches (e.g., B2C to B2B, startup to enterprise)
   - Seniority mismatches (targeting a level above or below recent roles)
   - Missing keywords that the target role requires
   - "Invisible" contributions — important work that doesn't translate to resume bullets
3. **Career narrative gaps**: Where the story doesn't connect. "You went from engineering at [Company A] to product at [Company B] — that transition is a story you'll need to tell well. Do you have one ready?"
4. **Story seeds**: Resume bullets that likely have rich stories behind them — flag these for storybank building. "This bullet about reducing churn by 40% — there's probably a strong story behind that. Let's capture it."

Feed these findings into the Kickoff Summary output (Profile Snapshot section) and into the initial coaching plan.

### Step 2.55: Career Transition Detection

After resume analysis, check whether the candidate's target role represents a career transition — a meaningful change in function, domain, seniority direction, or role type from their recent trajectory.

**Detection triggers** (any of these):
- Function change: engineering → product, sales → customer success, marketing → data science
- Domain shift: B2C → B2B, startup → enterprise, tech → non-tech (or vice versa)
- IC ↔ management switch: moving from hands-on IC to managing, or stepping back from management to IC
- Industry pivot: finance → healthcare, media → edtech, consulting → in-house
- Career restart: returning after a gap (parenting, health, sabbatical, career break)

**When detected**, this changes downstream coaching significantly:
- **Stories**: The candidate needs "bridge stories" — experiences that connect the old context to the new target. Flag this for `stories`: "You're making a [type] transition. We need to build 2-3 bridge stories that show how your [old context] experience translates to [new target]. This is the most important storybank work for your search."
- **Concerns**: The transition IS the primary concern. `concerns` should prioritize it.
- **Positioning**: `pitch` needs to frame the transition as intentional and strategic, not reactive. "I moved from X to Y because..." needs to be compelling.
- **Prep**: `prep` should expect interviewers to probe the transition — it will dominate at least one question.
- **Comp**: `salary` should flag that transitions often involve comp recalibration — the candidate's current comp may not be a useful anchor for the new role.

Save to coaching_state.md Profile:
```
- Career transition: [type — function change / domain shift / IC↔management / industry pivot / career restart]
- Transition narrative status: [not yet developed / in progress / strong]
```

If no transition is detected, don't mention it — most candidates have realistic, linear targets.

### Step 2.6: Target Reality Check

After resume analysis, cross-reference the candidate's profile against their stated target role(s). This is NOT a full fit assessment — it's a quick sanity check that fires only when clear mismatches are visible from the resume alone.

**Fire the check if any of these are true:**
- Seniority gap of 2+ levels (e.g., IC targeting VP, or junior targeting Staff)
- Zero domain experience for a domain-specific role (e.g., no healthcare experience targeting a healthcare PM role at a regulated company)
- Function switch without an obvious bridge (e.g., marketing → engineering, with nothing on the resume connecting the two)
- Target role requires hard skills the candidate demonstrably doesn't have (e.g., "5+ years of ML experience required" with no ML on resume)

**When triggered**, surface it directly but without gatekeeping:
"Looking at your resume against your target of [role], I want to flag something: [specific gap]. This doesn't mean you shouldn't go for it — but it means we should build a deliberate strategy for addressing this gap. Want to talk through your thinking on this target, or should we proceed and build the strongest case possible?"

**When NOT triggered**, say nothing. Don't manufacture concerns. Most candidates have realistic targets.

**If the candidate has multiple targets**, check each one. It's common for one target to be a strong fit and another to be a stretch — name this: "Your [Role A] target looks like a natural fit. Your [Role B] target is more of a stretch because [reason]. Both are worth pursuing, but they need different prep strategies."

### Step 3: Initialize Coaching State

Write the initial `coaching_state.md` file (see SKILL.md Session State System for format) with:
- Profile section populated from Steps 1-2
- Resume Analysis section populated from Step 2.5 output (positioning strengths, likely concerns, career narrative gaps, story seeds). This is critical — every downstream command (`concerns`, `prep`, `stories`, `hype`) benefits from having the resume analysis persisted. Don't lose this work.
- Empty storybank (or populated if initial stories were provided — if initial stories are provided, write full STAR text to the Story Details section)
- Empty score history, outcome log, drill progression at Stage 1
- Empty Interview Intelligence section (Question Bank, Effective Patterns, Ineffective Patterns, Recruiter/Interviewer Feedback, Company Patterns, Historical Intelligence Summary — all empty, will be populated by `analyze`, `debrief`, and `feedback`)
- Empty Active Coaching Strategy (will be populated after first `analyze` or `practice`)
- Empty Meta-Check Log table
- Empty Interview Loops section (will be populated by `research` or `prep`)
- Session log with kickoff entry
- Coaching Notes with any relevant observations from the kickoff conversation (e.g., interview anxiety, communication style preferences, emotional state about the job search)

### Mid-Search Profile Update

Candidates' targets often evolve mid-search — they discover they prefer a different role type, shift seniority targets based on market feedback, or pivot domains after informational interviews. When a candidate returns to `kickoff` or indicates their target has changed:

1. **Don't restart from scratch.** Ask: "What's changed? Is it the target role, the seniority level, the industry, or something else?"
2. **Show what carries over**: "Your storybank, practice scores, and coaching patterns all still apply. Here's what changes with your new target:"
3. **Update Profile in coaching_state.md**: Target role, seniority band, career transition status (if newly triggered).
4. **Flag downstream impacts**:
   - If target role changed: `concerns` needs re-running (different role = different concerns). `pitch` positioning statement needs updating. `resume` may need re-targeting.
   - If seniority changed: `prep` scoring weights shift. Practice drill calibration may need adjustment.
   - If domain changed: New domain gap becomes a primary concern. Bridge stories needed.
5. **Preserve history**: Don't delete old target data — move it to a "Previous targets" section. Score history, practice data, and storybank remain valid.

Output a brief "Profile Update Summary" showing what changed, what carries over, and the 2-3 highest-priority actions for the new target.

### Time-Aware Coaching

The interview timeline collected in Step 1 shapes everything:
- **≤48 hours**: Triage mode. Skip storybank building. Run `prep` → `hype` → done. Every minute counts.
- **1-2 weeks**: Focused mode. `prep` + one targeted `practice` drill on the weakest dimension. `stories` only to check for critical gaps.
- **3+ weeks**: Full system. Build storybank, run progression drills, develop differentiation. This is where the full value of the system is realized.

Adjust all recommendations to timeline. Never prescribe 3-week work to a candidate interviewing tomorrow.
